                    <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p>
                        Suki Meditation was founded in 2018 by two like minded friends Jerome and Akeem. They both have a keen passion for nature, health and life. some of the ways they express this is through physical and mental activities. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being a therapist, Akeem expressed that he wishes he could do more than help people by just talking to them. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>"It's one thing recommending meditation and qi gong to someone who has never considered it before. They'll more than likely try it once but not make it a routine afterwards. I wish I could get them all into a room and talk to them and guide them through these practises and explain to them exactly what it is they're doing and how it will benefit them".</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This gave Jerome an idea. His uncle owned a community center with a few spare rooms. They discussed the idea further and created Suki Meditations, a community club providing physical and mental practises that benefit our physical and spiritual being.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        The two friends have gathered a team of professional practitioners in Meditation, Yoga and Qigong that instruct the classes. Akeem has also included his therapy services to Suki Meditations and each staff member are always keen to talk to our members and provide necessary help if needed.
