## Features
The website consists of three pages, the Home, About and Sign up page. With the homepage, I have included multiple sections specific to each of the classes held at Suki Meditation. I have made it easier to to locate the different classes by adding buttons at the top of the home page that locate to the specific section of the page for example the Yoga button will take you to teh yoga section giving a brief explanation of the classes.

I have also ensured that everything is responsive due to the screen size including the following
### Top navigation bar
When on a standard width computer monitor, the brand logo appears on the left with the navigation buttons "Home, About and Sign Up" appear on the right. When condensed to a mobile screen, the Logo is stacked on top of the navigation links, both central.

### Class sections
When on a standard width computer monitor the text appears besides the image or video, on a condensed screen, the text stacks on top of the image.

This wasnt the case for the image given for the meditation section although it does size down for devices bigger than a mobile phone. It was an effort scaling it down for every screen size. I tried using percentages to do this but due to teh circular image being equalatral it was not easy so i decided to hide the image completely when the page width is lesser than 360 pixels.

As we as this, I decided to drop the background images on a smaller screen. This is because you cant really make out much of what the image was, so it didnt make sense having it there, so instead, when they are scaled down, teh background image is replace with a colour that matches the specific section's colour theme.
